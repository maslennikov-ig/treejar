# Claude Code CLI Adapter

- Target runtime: Claude Code CLI in the VS Code integrated terminal on WSL.
- Primary workflow comes from global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and the `orchestration-bridge` plugin.
- For medium/complex, risky, docs-sensitive, delegated, file-changing, or handoff-prone work, use `orchestration-bridge:orchestrator-stage`.
- Do not use `template-bridge` for new orchestration.
- Use Docs L1/L2: `@neuledge/context` first with lockfile-routed package/version; Context7 MCP or first-party docs as fallback only when L1 is missing, stale, or insufficient.
